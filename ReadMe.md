Unreal people database for testing the separate chained 
hash table with AVLTree chain. In the tests 
<b><i>86.195.895</i></b> people is generated in <i>people</i> file by
<i> database_generator.py</i>. <br>
All <b>ids</b> and <b>phone numbers</b> are unique.
An <b>id</b> is chosen by chance and tried to find in both linear
separate chaining and AVLTree separate chaining. <br>
<b>AVL Tree: 0.000043 seconds in average</b> <br>
<b>Linear: 0.066093 seconds in average</b>
